# Brewgle

Concept: We wanted to make a website that focused solely on the craft brewing industry. To help both the beer enthusiast and the normal drinker find and try new local beers for where ever they are located.


Process: We use the Yelp API to gather breweries from the city that the user requests with help from the Jquery UI autocomplete. Which is then made into an array and pushed into a list. Also from the array we used the Google maps API to place markers on the map to locate the breweries visually. For the aesthetics we used standard CSS and Bulma for the layout.
